VocabGenius is a study tool for students to learn their vocabulary efficiently. The student can create their own list of vocabulary by inputting a list of terms. The app handles the list and makes a series of calls to Pearson's Dictionary APIs that take less than 10 seconds depending on how many words and creates the list of terms with definitions and parts of speech. The lists are stored on the device so once the list is created, the student can access the list anywhere without the need of WiFi. 

The reason behind creating such an app was that we had many vocabulary lists and terms to define for our tests or quizzes in our APLang class. I often found myself searching for the definitions for a very long time and waste all that time just searching when I could be studying the terms instead. So, with VocabGenius the student can spend less time searching for the definition online and spend more time on actually studying!

I created this application for learning purposes and also for the Congressional App Challenge 2015 as a junior in high school. Although VocabGenius is a functional application, it should not be viewed as a refined and finished product. I did not understand the importance of annotating code and code readability at the time when I was just starting to apply basic programming skills.
